[[resource-discovery]]
== Resource Discovery in SE Environments

The Jakarta Persistence specification defines the ability for a provider to discover "managed resources" in EE environments, alleviating the application from manually listing all classes and XML files.
However, it defines no such support in SE environments.

Starting with 7.1, Hibernate now supports this discovery in SE environments, by allowing applications to specify the root URL and zero-or-more "jar" URLs to search.
These URLs correspond to

* `jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceUnitInfo#getPersistenceUnitRootUrl`
* `jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceUnitInfo#getJarFileUrls`

These URLs are searched for managed resources according to the process defined in https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.2#a12305[the specification].

[[locking]]
== Locking

`org.hibernate.Locking` has been introduced to support various aspects of pessimistic locking:

* `Locking.Scope` is an extension of `jakarta.persistence.PessimisticLockScope` including some Hibernate-specific options.
* `Locking.FollowOn` allows controlling Hibernate's follow-on locking behavior.

Additionally, we've added `org.hibernate.Timeouts` to help deal with some standard `jakarta.persistence.Timeout` values.


[[interceptor-merge]]
== Interceptor and merge

Support for intercepting `Session#merge` events has been added to Hibernate's `Interceptor`.
